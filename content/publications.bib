            In recent years, self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) anchored on metal oxides (MO) have greatly boosted the performance of inverted (p‐i‐n) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by serving as hole‐selective contacts due to their distinct advantages in transparency, hole‐selectivity, passivation, cost‐effectiveness, and processing efficiency. While the intrinsic monolayer nature of SAMs provides unique advantages, it also makes them highly sensitive to external pressure, posing a significant challenge for long‐term device stability. At present, the stability issue of SAM‐based PVSCs is gradually attracting attention. In this minireview, we discuss the fundamental stability issues arising from the structural characteristics, operating mechanisms, and roles of SAMs, and highlight representative works on improving their stability. We identify the buried interface stability concerns in three key aspects: 1) SAM/MO interface, 2) SAM inner layer, and 3) SAM/perovskite interface, corresponding to the anchoring group, linker group, and terminal group in the SAMs, respectively. Finally, we have proposed potential strategies for achieving excellent stability in SAM‐based buried interfaces, particularly for large‐scale and flexible applications. We believe this review will deepen understanding of the relationship between SAM structure and their device performance, thereby facilitating the design of novel SAMs and advancing their eventual commercialization in high‐efficiency and stable inverted PVSCs.},

              Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) are promising candidates for commercialization due to their outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, controlling the crystallization process and alleviating the phases/composition inhomogeneity represent a considerable challenge for perovskite layers grown on rough silicon substrates, ultimately limiting the efficiency and stability of TSC. Here, this study reports a “halide locking” strategy that simultaneously modulates the nucleation and crystal growth process of wide bandgap perovskites by introducing a multifunctional ammonium salt, thioacetylacetamide hydrochloride (TAACl), to bind with all types of cations and anions in the mixed halide perovskite precursor. The approach not only enables excellent compositional uniformity in the wet‐film stage but also induces preferred orientation along the (001) plane following nucleation, leading to enhanced homogeneity of the perovskite film in both vertical and horizontal directions over long‐length scales. The resulting wide‐bandgap perovskite solar cells yield exceptional open‐circuit voltage‐fill factor products (

              Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential for achieving high photovoltaic (PV) performance. However, the reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and fill factors (FFs) are still subpar due to the challenges associated with charge extraction in the organic bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) and significant energy losses in the interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here, a quaternary organic BHJ blend is developed to enhance the charge extraction in the organic subcell, contributing to an increased FF of ≥78\% under 1 sun illumination and even more under lower illumination intensities. Meanwhile, energy losses in the ICLs are reduced via the incorporation of a self‐assembly monolayer (SAM), (4‐(3,6‐Dimethyl‐9H‐carbazol‐9‐yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (Me‐4PACz), in organic BHJ to form a MoO

The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 25.56\% (certified: 24.65\%), with a record FF of 83.62\%, which is among the highest PCEs of POTSCs and the highest FF of all types of perovskite‐based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now. This work proves the optimization of charge extraction and ICLs are effective strategies to promote the performance of POTSCs to surpass other solution‐processed perovskite‐based TSCs in the near future.},

              Zinc‐halogen batteries are promising for sustainable energy storage, offering high redox capacities at economical price points. However, they are hindered by issues such as the irreversibility caused by the dissolution of intermediates and the sluggish charge transfer, which limit their widespread adoption. Addressing these issues, bismuth‐iodide perovskite cathodes are employed as a halogen element enriched model system. These perovskite cathodes demonstrate considerable anion redox capacities.

            To achieve carbon neutrality and sustainable development, innovative solar‐to‐fuel systems have been designed through the integration of solar energy harvesting and electrochemical devices. Over the last decade, there have been notable advancements in enhancing the efficiency and durability of these solar‐to‐fuel systems. Despite the advancements, there remains significant potential for further improvements in the performance of systems. Enhancements can be achieved by optimizing electrochemical catalysts, advancing the manufacturing technologies of photovoltaics and electrochemical cells, and refining the overall design of these systems. In the realm of catalyst optimization, the effectiveness of materials can be significantly improved through active site engineering and strategic use of functional groups. Similarly, the performance of electrochemical devices can be enhanced by incorporating specific additives into electrolytes and optimizing gas diffusion electrodes. Improvements in solar harvesting devices are achievable through efficient passivant and self‐assembled monolayers, which enhance the overall quality and efficiency of these systems. Additionally, optimizing the energy conversion efficiency involves the strategic use of DC converters, photoelectrodes, and redox media.

              Crystallization orientation plays a crucial role in determining the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), whereas effective strategies for realizing oriented perovskite crystallization is still lacking. Herein, a facile and efficient top‐down strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization orientation via treating perovskite wet film with propylamine chloride (PACl) before annealing. The PA

              ions tend to be adsorbed on the (001) facet of the perovskite surface, resulting in the reduced cleavage energy to induce (001) orientation‐dominated growth of perovskite film and then reduce the temperature of phase transition, meanwhile, the penetrating Cl ions further regulate the crystallization process. As‐prepared (001)‐dominant perovskite films exhibit the ameliorative film homogeneity in terms of vertical and horizontal scale, leading to alleviated lattice mismatch and lowered defect density. The resultant PVSC devices deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.07\% with enhanced stability, and the unencapsulated PVSC device maintains 95\% of its initial PCE after 1000 h of operation at the maximum power point under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.},

              Solution‐processed photodetectors have emerged as promising candidates for next‐generation of visible‐near infrared (vis–NIR) photodetectors. This is attributed to their ease of processing, compatibility with flexible substrates, and the ability to tune their detection properties by integrating complementary photoresponsive semiconductors. However, the limited performance continues to hinder their further development, primarily influenced by the difference of charge transport properties between perovskite and organic semiconductors. In this work, a perovskite‐organic bipolar photodetectors (PDs) is introduced with multispectral responsivity, achieved by effectively managing charges in perovskite and a ternary organic heterojunction. The ternary heterojunction, incorporating a designed NIR guest acceptor, exhibits a faster charge transfer rate and longer carrier diffusion length than the binary heterojunction. By achieving a more balanced carrier dynamic between the perovskite and organic components, the PD achieves a low dark current of 3.74 nA cm

              12
              Jones. Furthermore, a bioinspired retinotopic system for spontaneous chromatic adaptation is achieved without any optical filter. This charge management strategy opens up possibilities for surpassing the limitations of photodetection and enables the realization of high‐purity, compact image sensors with exceptional spatial resolution and accurate color reproduction.},

              All‐polymer solar cells (all‐PSCs) offer promising potential for large‐scale manufacturing due to their remarkable mechanical and thermal stability. However, the limited capacity of polymer acceptors for near‐infrared (NIR) photon harvesting has impeded their progress in semi‐transparent (ST) all‐PSCs. Here, the study develops a pair of new NIR polymer acceptors, named PYSeF‐T and PYSe2F‐T, with mono‐/di‐fluorinated end groups capped to the selenide monomer backbone, respectively. Owing to the stronger intermolecular interaction and intramolecular charge transfer effect of the di‐fluorinated end groups with the selenide backbone, PYSe2F‐T exhibits a stronger crystallinity and a more bathochromic absorption to 1000 nm. When blended with the donor, PM6, the PY2SeF‐T‐based all‐PSC demonstrates a higher efficiency of 16.73\% with a remarkable short‐circuit current (
              J
              SC
              ) of 27.7 mA cm

              J
              SC

Based on these, the ST device based on PM6:PYSe2F‐T demonstrates a superior efficiency of 12.52\% with an average visible transmittance of 26.2\% and a light utilization efficiency of 3.28\%, outperforming the mono‐fluorinated counterpart. The work provides an in‐depth understanding of the above synergistic effects to develop NIR polymer acceptors and establishes a solid foundation for future investigations into large‐area and flexible ST all‐PSCs.},

To address this challenge, herein, we present a novel design of solution-processible electron transporting material (ETM) by grafting a non-fullerene acceptor fragment onto C60. The synthesized BTPC60 exhibits an exceptional solution processability and well-organized molecular stacking pattern, enabling the formation of uniform and structurally ordered film with high electron mobility. When applied as ETL in inverted PSCs, BTPC60 not only exhibits excellent interfacial contact with the perovskite layer, resulting in enhanced electron extraction and transfer efficiency, but also effectively passivates the interfacial defects to suppress non-radiative recombination. Resultant BTPC60-based inverted PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.3 \% and retain almost 90 \% of the initial values after aging at 85 °C for 1500 hours in N2. More encouragingly, the solution-processed BTPC60 ETL demonstrates remarkable film thickness tolerance, and enables a high PCE up to 24.8 \% with the ETL thickness of 200 nm. Our results highlight BTPC60 as a promising solution-processed fullerene-based ETM, opening an avenue for improving the scalability of efficient and stable inverted PSCs.},

However, the low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of wide bandgap (Eg) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have hindered their development.

Furthermore, unencapsulated POTSCs exhibit excellent photo and thermal stability, retaining over 90\% of their initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking or exposure to 60 °C for 500 h.

            With the skyrocketed power conversion efficiency and enhanced lifetime of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), the environmental issues from materials to device processing, operation, and recycling become critical for their commercialization. Developing eco‐friendly PVSCs via the exploration of lead‐free perovskite materials, non‐toxic solvents, and effective lead‐adsorbing materials are the key points to realizing eco‐friendly PVSCs, which have drawn significant attention in the past 3 years. This critical review presents a comprehensive overview of the recent progress of eco‐friendly PVSCs in a close loop, including eco‐friendly perovskite materials, eco‐friendly device processing, eco‐friendly device operation, and eco‐friendly perovskite recycling. The innovation of perovskite materials, criteria of green solvent selection, and design principles of lead adsorbents are thoroughly introduced, with their combination for the device processing and operation well explained. An outlook of further material innovation and device optimization is provided to offer instruction for the development of this research field.

              Metal–organic framework (MOF) solids with their variable functionalities are relevant for energy conversion technologies. However, the development of electroactive and stable MOFs for electrocatalysis still faces challenges. Here, a molecularly engineered MOF system featuring a 2D coordination network based on mercaptan–metal links (e.g., nickel, as for Ni(DMBD)‐MOF) is designed. The crystal structure is solved from microcrystals by a continuous‐rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique. Computational results indicate a metallic electronic structure of Ni(DMBD)‐MOF due to the Ni–S coordination, highlighting the effective design of the thiol ligand for enhancing electroconductivity. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that (DMBD)‐MOF offers advantages in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over non‐thiol (e.g., 1,4‐benzene dicarboxylic acid) analog (BDC)‐MOF, because it poses fewer energy barriers during the rate‐limiting *O intermediate formation step. Iron‐substituted NiFe(DMBD)‐MOF achieves a current density of 100 mA cm

            Tuning the properties of non‐fullerene acceptors (NFAs) through halogenation, including fluorination and chlorination, represents one of the most promising strategies to boost the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it remains unclear how the F and Cl choice influences the molecular packing and performance between small‐molecule and polymeric acceptors. Here, a series of small‐molecule and polymeric acceptors with different amounts and types of halogenation is synthesized, and the effects of fluorination and chlorination between small‐molecule and polymeric acceptors are investigated. It is found that chlorinated small‐molecule acceptors lead to longer exciton diffusion length and better performance compared to the corresponding fluorinated ones, which attributes to their stronger intermolecular packing mode. For polymer acceptors, in contrast, the fluorinated polymers achieve a denser packing mode and better performance, because chlorinated polymers exhibit reduced intrachain conjugation between end group moieties and linker units. This study demonstrates different halogenation effects on the packing modes and performances for small‐molecule and polymeric acceptors, which provides important guidance for the molecule design of high‐performance acceptors for OSCs.},

            The commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) urgently requires the development of green‐solvent processable dopant‐free hole transporting materials (HTMs). However, strong intermolecular interactions that ensure high hole mobility always compromise the solubility and film‐forming ability in green solvents. Herein, we show a simple but effective design strategy to solve this trade‐off, that is, constructing star‐shaped D‐A‐D structure. The resulting HTMs (BTP1‐2) can be processed by green solvent of 2‐methylanisole (2MA), a kind of food additive, and show high hole mobility and multiple defect passivation effects. An impressive efficiency of 24.34 \% has been achieved for 2MA‐processed BTP1 based inverted PVSCs, the highest value for green‐solvent processable HTMs so far. Moreover, it is manifested that the charge separation of D‐A type HTMs at the photoinduced excited state can help to passivate the defects of perovskites, indicating a new HTM design insight.},

              The interface and crystallinity of perovskite films play a decisive role in determining the device performance, which is significantly influenced by the bottom hole‐transporting material (HTM) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, a simple design strategy of polymer HTMs is reported, which can modulate the wettability and promote the anchoring by introducing pyridine units into the polyarylamine backbone, so as to realize efficient and stable inverted PVSCs. The HTM properties can be effectively modified by varying the linkage sites of pyridine units, and 3,5‐linked PTAA‐P1 particularly demonstrates a more regulated molecular configuration for interacting with perovskites, leading to highly crystalline perovskite films with uniform back contact and reduced defect density. Dopant‐free PTAA‐P1‐based inverted PVSCs have realized remarkable efficiencies of 24.89\% (certified value: 24.50\%) for small‐area (0.08 cm

              Among the emerging photovoltaic technologies, rigid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made tremendous development owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.7\%. However, the record PCE of flexible PSCs (≈22.4\%) still lags far behind their rigid counterparts and their mechanical stabilities are also not satisfactory. Herein, through modifying the interface between perovskite and hole transport layer via pentylammonium acetate (PenAAc) molecule a highly efficient and stable flexible inverted PSC is reported.

            Inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have recently made exciting progress, showing high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25\% in single-junction devices and 30.5\% in silicon/perovskite tandem devices. The hole transporting material (HTM) in an inverted PVSC plays an important role in determining the device performance, since it not only extracts/transports holes but also affects the growth and crystallization of perovskite film. Currently, polymer and self-assembled monolayer (SAM) have been considered as two types of most promising HTM candidates for inverted PVSCs owing to their high PCEs, high stability and adaptability to large area devices. In this review, recent encouraging progress of high-performance polymer and SAM-based HTMs is systematically reviewed and summarized, including molecular design strategies and the correlation between molecular structure and device performance. We hope this review can inspire further innovative development of HTMs for wide applications in highly efficient and stable inverted PVSCs and the tandem devices.

            All‐polymer solar cells (all‐PSCs) have achieved impressive progress in photovoltaic performance and stabilities recently. However, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) still trail that of small‐molecular acceptor‐based organic solar cells ({\textgreater}19\%) mainly because of the inferior fill factor (FF). Herein, a combined homo hydrocarbon solvent and sequential deposition (SD) strategy is presented to boost the FF of rigid all‐PSCs to 77.7\% and achieve a superior PCE of 17.7\% with excellent stability, which is among the highest efficiencies reported for all‐PSCs thus far. Meanwhile, a remarkable PCE of 14.5\% is realized for flexible all‐PSCs with outstanding mechanical stability. The blend film morphologies measurements suggest that the SD method enables the formation of an ideal pseudo‐bilayer film with bicontinuous interdigitated structure and ordered polymer packing. The numerical simulation result indicates that the FF enhancement mainly results from the efficient exciton diffusion dynamics, increased carrier mobilities, and more balanced electron/hole mobility ratio induced by the developed SD method. This is also confirmed by the FF loss analysis, which manifests that the reduced series resistance and increased shunt resistance are the main reasons for the reduction of FF loss. This work provides a promising strategy to fabricate highly efficient and stable all‐PSCs to promote their future development and practical manufacturing.},

To this end, a facile strategy to construct a 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to reduce the energy loss in PVSCs is developed. The heterostructure is contrived through the van der Waals integration of 2D perovskite ((BA)

              3
              ‐based perovskites, which serves as a barrier to suppress the trap‐assisted recombination at the interface. As a result, a satisfying PCE of 24.48\% is achieved with an improved open‐circuit voltage (
              V
              OC
              ) from 1.13 to 1.17 V. Moreover, the 2D perovskite nanosheets can effectively mitigate the iodide ion diffusion from perovskite to the metal electrode, hence enhancing the device stability. 3D/2D architectured devices retain ≈90\% of their initial PCE under continuous illumination or heating after 1000 h, which are superior to 3D‐based devices. This work provides an effective and controllable strategy to construct 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to simultaneously boost the efficiency and stability of PVSCs.},

              The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to electrochemical hydrogen production. However, designing and fabricating efficient electrocatalysts still remains challenging. By confinedly coordinating organic ligands with metal species in layered double hydroxides (LDHs), an innovative LDHs‐assisted approach is developed to facilely synthesize freestanding bimetallic 2D metal–organic framework nanosheets (2D MOF NSs), preserving the metallic components and activities in OER. Furthermore, the research has demonstrated that the incorporation of carboxyl organic ligands coordinated with metal atoms as proton transfer mediators endow 2D MOF NSs with efficient proton transfer during the electrochemical OH

              . When this strategy is applied to LDH nanosheets grown on nickel foam, the overpotential can be reduced to 221 mV. This outstanding OER activity supports the capability of multimetallic organic frameworks for the rational design of water oxidation electrocatalysts. This strategy provides a universal path to the synthesis of 2D MOF NSs that can be used as electrocatalysts directly.},

	abstract = {State-of-art Y-series polymer acceptors are typically based on a mono-thiophene linker, which can cause some twisted molecular conformations and thus limit the performance of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). Here, a high-performance polymer acceptor based on vinylene linkers is reported, which leads to surprising changes in the polymers’ molecular conformations, optoelectronic properties, and enhanced photovoltaic performance. It is found that the polymer acceptors based on thiophene or bithiophene linkers (PY-T-γ and PY-2T-γ) display significant molecular twisting between end-groups and linker units, while the vinylene-based polymer (PY-V-γ) exhibits a more coplanar and rigid molecular conformation. As a result, PY-V-γ demonstrates a better conjugation and tighter interchain stacking, which results in higher mobility and a reduced energetic disorder. Furthermore, detailed morphology investigations reveal that the PY-V-γ-based blend exhibits high domain purity and thus a better fill factor in its all-PSCs. With these, a higher efficiency of 17.1\% is achieved in PY-V-γ-based all-PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for binary all-PSCs to date. This work demonstrates that the vinylene-linker is a superior unit to build polymer acceptors with more coplanar and rigid chain conformation, which is beneficial for polymer aggregation and efficient all-PSCs.},

              The potential leakage of lead from degraded perovskite photovoltaics poses a threat to the ecosystem and human health, which is a severe hurdle for their commercialization, especially for flexible modules that are often integrated in applications used in daily living. To trap the lead from degraded flexible perovskite solar modules (PVSMs), sulfonated graphene aerogels mixed with polydimethylsiloxane are employed to serve as lead‐absorbing encapsulants on both sides of flexible PVSMs. The large specific area of sulfonated graphene aerogels and their high binding energy with Pb

Moreover, the lead from degraded flexible PVSMs can be minimized to far below the hazardous waste limit according to the resource conservation and recovery act regulation (RCRA). This work provides an effective strategy to realize safe‐to‐use perovskite‐based flexible electronics to facilitate their commercialization.},

              Lead halide perovskite and organic solar cells (PSCs and OSCs) are considered as the prime candidates currently for clean energy applications due to their solution and low‐temperature processibility. Nevertheless, the substantial photon loss in near‐infrared (NIR) region and relatively large photovoltage deficit need to be improved to enable their uses in high‐performance solar cells. To mitigate these disadvantages, low‐bandgap organic bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) layer into inverted PSCs to construct facile hybrid solar cells (HSCs) is integrated. By optimizing the BHJ components, an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.80\%, with a decent open‐circuit voltage (

The resultant devices also exhibit superior long‐term (over 1000 h) ambient‐ and photostability compared to those from single‐component PSCs and OSCs. More importantly, a champion PCE of 21.73\% and excellent mechanical durability can also be achieved in flexible HSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for flexible solar cells to date. Taking advantage of these impressive device performances, flexible HSCs into a power source for wearable sensors to demonstrate real‐time temperature monitoring are successfully integrated.},

              Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO
              2

              2
              to value‐added chemicals and fuels by utilizing renewable electricity. To date, the electrochemical reduction of CO
              2

              It is highly desirable for all‐inorganic perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) to have reduced nonideal interfacial charge recombination in order to improve the performance. Although the construction of a 2D capping layer on 3D perovskite is an effective way to suppress interfacial nonradiative recombination, it is difficult to apply it to all‐inorganic perovskites because of the resistance of Cs
              +
              cesium ions in cation exchange reactions. To alleviate this problem, a simple approach using an ultra‐thin 2D perovskite to terminate CsPbI
              3
              grain boundaries (GBs) without damaging the original 3D perovskite is developed. The 2D perovskite at the GBs not only enhances the charge‐carrier extraction and transport but also effectively suppresses nonradiative recombination. In addition, because the 2D perovskite can prevent the moisture and oxygen from penetrating into the GBs and at the same time suppress the ion migration, the 2D terminated CsPbI
              3
              films exhibit significantly improved stability against humidity. Moreover, the devices without encapsulation can retain ≈81\% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after being stored at 40 ± 5\% relative humidity for 84 h. The 2D‐based champion device exhibits a high PCE of 18.82\% with a high open‐circuit voltage of 1.16 V.},

              Currently, the performance improvement for inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is mainly limited by the high open circuit voltage (

              ) loss caused by detrimental non‐radiative recombination (NRR) processes.

              PPY2

              Y6, as a state‐of‐the‐art nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), is extensively optimized by modifying its side chains and terminal groups. However, the conformation effects on molecular properties and photovoltaic performance of Y6 and its derivatives have not yet been systematically studied. Herein, three Y6 analogs, namely, BP4T‐4F, BP5T‐4F, and ABP4T‐4F, are designed and synthesized. Owing to the asymmetric molecular design strategies, three representative molecular conformations for Y6‐type NFAs are obtained through regulating the lateral thiophene orientation of the fused core. It is found that conformation adjustment imposes comprehensive effects on the molecular properties in neat and blend films of these NFAs. As a result, organic solar cells (OSCs) fabricated with PM6:BP4T‐4F, PM6:BP5T‐4F, and PM6:ABP4T‐4F show high power conversion efficiency of 17.1\%, 16.7\%, and 15.2\%, respectively. Interestingly, these NFAs with different conformations also show reduced energy loss (
              E
              loss
              ) in devices via gradually suppressed nonradiative
              E
              loss
              . Moreover, by employing a selenium‐containing analog, CH1007, as the complementary third component, ternary OSCs based on PM6:BP5T‐4F:CH1007 (1:1.02:0.18) achieve a 17.2\% efficiency. This work helps shed light on engineering the molecular conformation of NFAs to achieve high efficiency OSCs with reduced voltage loss.},

            Bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) are prepared by a common one‐step solution casting of donor‐acceptor blends often encounter dynamic morphological evolution which is hard to control to achieve optimal performance. To overcome this hurdle, a generally applicable, sequential processing approach has been developed to construct high‐performance OSCs without involving tedious processes. The morphology of photoactive layers comprising a polymer donor (PM6) and a nonfullerene acceptor (denoted as Y6‐BO) can be precisely manipulated by tuning Y6‐BO layer with a small amount of 1‐chloronaphthalene additive to induce the structural order of Y6‐BO molecules to impact the blend phase. The results of a comparative investigation elucidate that such two‐step procedure can afford more favorable BHJ microstructure than that achievable with the single blend‐casting route. This translates into improved carrier generation and transport, and suppressed charge recombination. Consequently, the devices based on sequential deposition (SD) deliver a remarkable efficiency up to 17.2\% (the highest for SD OSCs to date), outperforming that from the conventional BHJ devices (16.4\%). The general applicability of this approach has also been tested on several other nonfullerene acceptors which show similar improvements. These results highlight that SD is a promising processing alternative to promote better photovoltaic performance and reduce production requirements.},

              Perovskite‐organic tandem solar cells are attracting more attention due to their potential for highly efficient and flexible photovoltaic device.

The resulting perovskite‐organic tandem solar cells with passivated wide‐bandgap perovskite show a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.13\%, with an open‐circuit voltage (

              Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phase 2D layered perovskites with diammonium organic cations demonstrate improved stability over 3D perovskites under thermal/photo/moisture stresses. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DJ phase perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is often limited by the poor charge transport across the perovskite layers due to the crystal growth direction that tends to be parallel to the substrate. Here, a simple and effective method is demonstrated by employing a NH

              Generally, high light‐harvesting efficiency, electron‐injection efficiency, and charge‐collection efficiency are the prerequisites for high‐efficiency quantum‐dot‐sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). However, it is fairly difficult for a single QD sensitizer to meet these three requirements simultaneously. It is demonstrated that these parameters can be felicitously balanced by a cosensitization strategy through the adoption of environmental‐friendly Zn–Cu–In–Se and Zn–Cu–In–S dual QD sensitizers with cascade energy structure. Experimental results indicate that: i) the combination of the dual QDs can improve the light‐harvesting capability of the cells, especially in the visible light window; ii) the cosensitization approach can facilitate electron injection, benefitting from the cascade energy structure of the two QD sensitizers employed; iii) the charge‐collection efficiency can be remarkably enhanced by the suppressed charge‐recombination process due to the improved QD coverage on TiO
              2

              Although organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have achieved dramatic improvement in device efficiency, their long‐term stability remains a major concern prior to commercialization. To address this issue, extensive research efforts are dedicated to exploiting all‐inorganic PVSCs by using cesium (Cs)‐based perovskite materials, such as α‐CsPbI
              3
              . However, the black‐phase CsPbI

              and orthorhombic γ‐CsPbI
              3
              phases) is not stable at room temperature, and it tends to convert to the nonperovskite δ‐CsPbI
              3
              phase. Here, a simple yet effective approach is described to prepare stable black‐phase CsPbI

Such heterostructure is manifested to enable the realization of a stable all‐inorganic PVSC with a high power conversion efficiency of 16.39\%. This work provides a new perspective for developing high‐performance and stable all‐inorganic PVSCs.},

              Although perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have achieved rapid progress in the past few years, most of the high‐performance device results are based on the doped small molecule hole‐transporting material (HTM), spiro‐OMeTAD, which affects their long‐term stability. In addition, some defects from under‐coordinated Pb atoms on the surface of perovskite films can also result in nonradiative recombination to affect device performance. To alleviate these problems, a dopant‐free HTM based on a donor‐acceptor polymer, PBT1‐C, synthesized from the copolymerization between the benzodithiophene and 1,3‐bis(4‐(2‐ethylhexyl)thiophen‐2‐yl)‐5,7‐bis(2‐alkyl)benzo[1,2‐

              ′]dithiophene‐4,8‐dione units is introduced. PBT1‐C not only possesses excellent hole mobility, but is also able to passivate the surface traps of the perovskite films. The derived PVSC shows a high power conversion efficiency of 19.06\% with a very high fill factor of 81.22\%, which is the highest reported for dopant‐free polymeric HTMs. The results from photoluminescence and trap density of states measurements validate that PBT1‐C can effectively passivate both surface and grain boundary traps of the perovskite.},

              Composition engineering is a particularly simple and effective approach especially using mixed cations and halide anions to optimize the morphology, crystallinity, and light absorption of perovskite films. However, there are very few reports on the use of anion substitutions to develop uniform and highly crystalline perovskite films with large grain size and reduced defects. Here, the first report of employing tetrafluoroborate (BF

These advantages benefit the performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), resulting in an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.16\% from 17.55\% due to enhanced open‐circuit voltage (
