Dr. Zhu obtained his B.S. degree (Chemistry) in 2010 from Nanjing University (China). In 2015, he earned his Ph.D. degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Then he moved to the department of materials science and engineering in University of Washington, Seattle and worked as a postdoctoral fellow during 2015-2017. He moved back to HKUST as visiting scholar in 2017. Dr. Zhu joined the City University of Hong Kong as an Assistant Professor in June 2018.

His research mainly focuses on the design inorganic/organic materials, as well connecting the materials synthesis, physical properties and device performance for optoelectronics application. The current application interests include solar cells, transistors, light-emitting diodes, and electrochemical devices (e.g. batteries, supercapacitors).
