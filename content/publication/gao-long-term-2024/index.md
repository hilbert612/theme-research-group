abstract: Robust contact schemes that boost stability and simplify the production
  process are needed for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We codeposited perovskite
  and hole-selective contact while protecting the perovskite to enable deposition
  of SnO  x  /Ag without the use of a fullerene. The SnO  x  , prepared through atomic
  layer deposition, serves as a durable inorganic electron transport layer. Tailoring
  the oxygen vacancy defects in the SnO  x  layer led to power conversion efficiencies
  (PCEs) of textgreater25%. Our devices exhibit superior stability over conventional
  p-i-n PSCs, successfully meeting several benchmark stability tests. They retained
  textgreater95% PCE after 2000 hours of continuous operation at their maximum power
  point under simulated AM1.5 illumination at 65°C. Additionally, they boast a certified
  T 97 lifetime exceeding 1000 hours.  ,  Editor’s summary  The long-term stability
  of perovskite solar cells has been improved with an atomic-layer deposition (ALD)
  method that replaces the fullerene electron transport layer with tin oxide. Gao
  et al . first deposited the perovskite and the hole-transporter layer in a single
  step. Then, they used ALD to create an oxygen-deficient tin oxide layer to reduce
  the band offset to a thicker, overgrown layer of normal tin oxide. Solar cells had
  a power conversion efficiency of more than 25%, and they retained more than 95%
  of efficiency after 2000 hours of maximum power point operations at 65°C. —Phil
