abstract: "Robust contact schemes that boost stability and simplify the production process are needed for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We codeposited perovskite and hole-selective contact while protecting the perovskite to enable deposition of SnOx/Ag without the use of a fullerene. The SnOx, prepared through atomic layer deposition, serves as a durable inorganic electron transport layer. Tailoring the oxygen vacancy defects in the SnOx layer led to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >25%. Our devices exhibit superior stability over conventional p-i-n PSCs, successfully meeting several benchmark stability tests."
