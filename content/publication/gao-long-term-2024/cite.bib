Editor’s summary

The long-term stability of perovskite solar cells has been improved with an atomic-layer deposition (ALD) method that replaces the fullerene electron transport layer with tin oxide. Gao
et al
. first deposited the perovskite and the hole-transporter layer in a single step. Then, they used ALD to create an oxygen-deficient tin oxide layer to reduce the band offset to a thicker, overgrown layer of normal tin oxide. Solar cells had a power conversion efficiency of more than 25%, and they retained more than 95% of efficiency after 2000 hours of maximum power point operations at 65°C. —Phil Szuromi},
