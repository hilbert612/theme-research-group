abstract: Abstract  Solution‐processed photodetectors have emerged as promising candidates
  for next‐generation of visible‐near infrared (vis–NIR) photodetectors. This is attributed
  to their ease of processing, compatibility with flexible substrates, and the ability
  to tune their detection properties by integrating complementary photoresponsive
  semiconductors. However, the limited performance continues to hinder their further
  development, primarily influenced by the difference of charge transport properties
  between perovskite and organic semiconductors. In this work, a perovskite‐organic
  bipolar photodetectors (PDs) is introduced with multispectral responsivity, achieved
  by effectively managing charges in perovskite and a ternary organic heterojunction.
  The ternary heterojunction, incorporating a designed NIR guest acceptor, exhibits
  a faster charge transfer rate and longer carrier diffusion length than the binary
  heterojunction. By achieving a more balanced carrier dynamic between the perovskite
  and organic components, the PD achieves a low dark current of 3.74 nA cm −2 at −0.2 V,
  a fast response speed of textless10 µs, and a detectivity of exceeding 10 12 Jones.
  Furthermore, a bioinspired retinotopic system for spontaneous chromatic adaptation
  is achieved without any optical filter. This charge management strategy opens up
  possibilities for surpassing the limitations of photodetection and enables the realization
  of high‐purity, compact image sensors with exceptional spatial resolution and accurate
  color reproduction.
