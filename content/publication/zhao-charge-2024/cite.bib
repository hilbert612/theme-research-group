Solution‐processed photodetectors have emerged as promising candidates for next‐generation of visible‐near infrared (vis–NIR) photodetectors. This is attributed to their ease of processing, compatibility with flexible substrates, and the ability to tune their detection properties by integrating complementary photoresponsive semiconductors. However, the limited performance continues to hinder their further development, primarily influenced by the difference of charge transport properties between perovskite and organic semiconductors. In this work, a perovskite‐organic bipolar photodetectors (PDs) is introduced with multispectral responsivity, achieved by effectively managing charges in perovskite and a ternary organic heterojunction. The ternary heterojunction, incorporating a designed NIR guest acceptor, exhibits a faster charge transfer rate and longer carrier diffusion length than the binary heterojunction. By achieving a more balanced carrier dynamic between the perovskite and organic components, the PD achieves a low dark current of 3.74 nA cm

Jones. Furthermore, a bioinspired retinotopic system for spontaneous chromatic adaptation is achieved without any optical filter. This charge management strategy opens up possibilities for surpassing the limitations of photodetection and enables the realization of high‐purity, compact image sensors with exceptional spatial resolution and accurate color reproduction.},
