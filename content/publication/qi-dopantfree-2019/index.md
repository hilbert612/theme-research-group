abstract: Abstract  Although perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have achieved rapid progress
  in the past few years, most of the high‐performance device results are based on
  the doped small molecule hole‐transporting material (HTM), spiro‐OMeTAD, which affects
  their long‐term stability. In addition, some defects from under‐coordinated Pb atoms
  on the surface of perovskite films can also result in nonradiative recombination
  to affect device performance. To alleviate these problems, a dopant‐free HTM based
  on a donor‐acceptor polymer, PBT1‐C, synthesized from the copolymerization between
  the benzodithiophene and 1,3‐bis(4‐(2‐ethylhexyl)thiophen‐2‐yl)‐5,7‐bis(2‐alkyl)benzo[1,2‐
  c :4,5‐ c ′]dithiophene‐4,8‐dione units is introduced. PBT1‐C not only possesses
  excellent hole mobility, but is also able to passivate the surface traps of the
  perovskite films. The derived PVSC shows a high power conversion efficiency of 19.06%
  with a very high fill factor of 81.22%, which is the highest reported for dopant‐free
  polymeric HTMs. The results from photoluminescence and trap density of states measurements
  validate that PBT1‐C can effectively passivate both surface and grain boundary traps
  of the perovskite.
