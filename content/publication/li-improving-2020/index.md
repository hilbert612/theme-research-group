abstract: Passivation strategies are considered as one of the most efficient methods
  to suppress nonradiative recombination of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite
  solar cells (PSCs), leading to tremendous photovoltaic performance. An innovative
  2D polymer, graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ), as well as various organic groups
  (amino, sulfonic, nitrato, and hydroxy group), are widely used as passivation agents,
  according to the previous reports. Anchoring g‐C 3 N 4 and the aforementioned organic
  groups as additives in perovskite can both heal charged defects around the grain
  boundaries by passivating the charge recombination center. In addition, the crystalline
  quality can also be enhanced by the incorporation of g‐C 3 N 4 , leading to improved
  conductivity of perovskite light absorber films that is beneficial for benign charge
  extraction efficiency. Inspired by the underlining mechanisms, a series of novel
  passivation molecules, functionalized g‐C 3 N 4 (F‐C 3 N 4 ) with assorted organic
  groups, is designed herein, yielding a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE)
  of 20.08% for NO 3 ‐C 3 N 4 ‐based p‐i‐n structure PSC, in comparison with that
  of PSC without passivation (17.85%). These findings present an efficient strategy
  to understand and design multiple facets of applications of novel passivation molecules
  to further improve the PCE of PSCs.
