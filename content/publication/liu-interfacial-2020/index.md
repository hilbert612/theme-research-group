abstract: A highly effective interface engineering approach uses a multifunctional
  molecule, 5‐amino‐2,4,6‐triiodoisophthalic acid (ATPA), to anchor on TiO 2 and CsPbI
  3 simultaneously by reacting with dangling hydroxyl groups on TiO 2 surfaces and
  passivating the defects of CsPbI 3 films. In addition, the introduction of ATPA
  results in cascade energy‐level alignment between the perovskite and TiO 2 electron‐transporting
  layer (ETL) to improve the electron extraction property. Based on the ATPA‐modified
  TiO 2 substrates, optimized CsPbI 3 perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) deliver the highest
  power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 18% with suppressed hysteresis. Moreover,
  the unencapsulated TiO 2 /ATPA‐based devices exhibit much better long‐term stability
  and photostability than the only TiO 2 ‐based devices.
