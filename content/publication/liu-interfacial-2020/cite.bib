 abstract = {A highly effective interface engineering approach uses a multifunctional molecule, 5‐amino‐2,4,6‐triiodoisophthalic acid (ATPA), to anchor on TiO
2
and CsPbI
3
simultaneously by reacting with dangling hydroxyl groups on TiO
2
surfaces and passivating the defects of CsPbI
3
films. In addition, the introduction of ATPA results in cascade energy‐level alignment between the perovskite and TiO
2
electron‐transporting layer (ETL) to improve the electron extraction property. Based on the ATPA‐modified TiO
2
substrates, optimized CsPbI

perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) deliver the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 18% with suppressed hysteresis. Moreover, the unencapsulated TiO

/ATPA‐based devices exhibit much better long‐term stability and photostability than the only TiO

‐based devices.},
