abstract: Abstract  The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to electrochemical
  hydrogen production. However, designing and fabricating efficient electrocatalysts
  still remains challenging. By confinedly coordinating organic ligands with metal
  species in layered double hydroxides (LDHs), an innovative LDHs‐assisted approach
  is developed to facilely synthesize freestanding bimetallic 2D metal–organic framework
  nanosheets (2D MOF NSs), preserving the metallic components and activities in OER.
  Furthermore, the research has demonstrated that the incorporation of carboxyl organic
  ligands coordinated with metal atoms as proton transfer mediators endow 2D MOF NSs
  with efficient proton transfer during the electrochemical OH ads → O ads transition.
  These freestanding NiFe‐2D MOF NSs require a small overpotential of 260 mV for a
  current density of 10 mA cm –2 . When this strategy is applied to LDH nanosheets
  grown on nickel foam, the overpotential can be reduced to 221 mV. This outstanding
  OER activity supports the capability of multimetallic organic frameworks for the
  rational design of water oxidation electrocatalysts. This strategy provides a universal
  path to the synthesis of 2D MOF NSs that can be used as electrocatalysts directly.
