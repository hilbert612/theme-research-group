abstract: Abstract  Perovskite‐organic tandem solar cells are attracting more attention
  due to their potential for highly efficient and flexible photovoltaic device. In
  this work, efficient perovskite‐organic monolithic tandem solar cells integrating
  the wide bandgap perovskite (1.74 eV) and low bandgap organic active PBDB‐T:SN6IC‐4F
  (1.30 eV) layer, which serve as the top and bottom subcell, respectively, are developed.
  The resulting perovskite‐organic tandem solar cells with passivated wide‐bandgap
  perovskite show a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.13%, with an
  open‐circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 1.85 V, a short‐circuit photocurrent ( J sc ) of
  11.52 mA cm −2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 70.98%. Thanks to the advantages of low
  temperature fabrication processes and the flexibility properties of the device,
  a flexible tandem solar cell which obtain a PCE of 13.61%, with V oc of 1.80 V,
  J sc of 11.07 mA cm −2 , and FF of 68.31% is fabricated. Moreover, to demonstrate
  the achieved high V oc in the tandem solar cells for potential applications, a photovoltaic
  (PV)‐driven electrolysis system combing the tandem solar cell and water splitting
  electrocatalysis is assembled. The integrated device demonstrates a solar‐to‐hydrogen
  efficiency of 12.30% and 11.21% for rigid, and flexible perovskite‐organic tandem
  solar cell based PV‐driven electrolysis systems, respectively.
