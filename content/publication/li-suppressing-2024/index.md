abstract: Abstract  Inorganic nickel oxide (NiO  x  ) is an ideal hole transport material
  (HTM) for the fabrication of high‐efficiency, stable, and large‐area perovskite
  photovoltaic devices because of its low cost, stability, and ease of solution processing.
  However, it delivers low power conversion efficiency (PCE) in tin perovskite solar
  cells (TPSCs) compared to other organic HTMs. Here, the origin of hole transport
  barriers at the perovskite–NiO  x  interface is identified and a self‐assembled
  monolayer interface modification is developed, through introducing (4‐(7 H ‐dibenzo[
  c , g ]carbazol‐7‐yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (2PADBC) into the perovskite–NiO  x  interface.
  The 2PADBC anchors undercoordinated Ni cations through phosphonic acid groups, suppressing
  the reaction of highly active Ni ≥3+ defects with perovskites, while increasing
  the electron density and oxidation activation energy of Sn at the perovskite interface,
  reducing the interface nonradiative recombination caused by tetravalent Sn defects.
  The devices deliver significantly increased open‐circuit voltage from 0.712 to 0.825 V,
  boosting the PCE to 14.19% for the small‐area device and 12.05% for the large‐area
  (1 cm 2 ) device. In addition, the 2PADBC modification enhances the operational
  stability of NiO  x  ‐based TPSCs, maintaining more than 93% of their initial efficiency
  after 1000 h.
