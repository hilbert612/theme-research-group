abstract: Abstract  Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) offers
  a promising way of effectively converting CO 2 to value‐added chemicals and fuels
  by utilizing renewable electricity. To date, the electrochemical reduction of CO
  2 to single‐carbon products, especially carbon monoxide and formate, has been well
  achieved. However, the efficient conversion of CO 2 to more valuable multicarbon
  products (e.g., ethylene, ethanol, n ‐propanol, and n ‐butanol) is difficult and
  still under intense investigation. Here, recent progresses in the electrochemical
  CO 2 reduction to multicarbon products using copper‐based catalysts are reviewed.
  First, the mechanism of CO 2 RR is briefly described. Then, representative approaches
  of catalyst engineering are introduced toward the formation of multicarbon products
  in CO 2 RR, such as composition, morphology, crystal phase, facet, defect, strain,
  and surface and interface. Subsequently, key aspects of cell engineering for CO
  2 RR, including electrode, electrolyte, and cell design, are also discussed. Finally,
  recent advances are summarized and some personal perspectives in this research direction
  are provided.
