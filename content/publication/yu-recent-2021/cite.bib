Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO
2
RR) offers a promising way of effectively converting CO
2
to value‐added chemicals and fuels by utilizing renewable electricity. To date, the electrochemical reduction of CO
2
to single‐carbon products, especially carbon monoxide and formate, has been well achieved. However, the efficient conversion of CO
2
to more valuable multicarbon products (e.g., ethylene, ethanol,
n
‐propanol, and
n
‐butanol) is difficult and still under intense investigation. Here, recent progresses in the electrochemical CO
2
reduction to multicarbon products using copper‐based catalysts are reviewed. First, the mechanism of CO
2
RR is briefly described. Then, representative approaches of catalyst engineering are introduced toward the formation of multicarbon products in CO
2
RR, such as composition, morphology, crystal phase, facet, defect, strain, and surface and interface. Subsequently, key aspects of cell engineering for CO
2
RR, including electrode, electrolyte, and cell design, are also discussed. Finally, recent advances are summarized and some personal perspectives in this research direction are provided.},
