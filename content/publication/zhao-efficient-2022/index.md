abstract: Abstract  Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn great attention due
  to their high processability and superior photovoltaic properties. However, their
  further development is often hindered by severe nonradiative recombination at interfaces
  that decreases power conversion efficiency (PCE). To this end, a facile strategy
  to construct a 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to reduce the energy loss in PVSCs
  is developed. The heterostructure is contrived through the van der Waals integration
  of 2D perovskite ((BA) 4 AgBiBr 8 ) nanosheets onto the surface of 3D‐FAPbI 3 ‐based
  perovskites. The large bandgap of (BA) 4 AgBiBr 8 enables the formation of type‐I
  heterojunction with 3D‐FAPbI 3 ‐based perovskites, which serves as a barrier to
  suppress the trap‐assisted recombination at the interface. As a result, a satisfying
  PCE of 24.48% is achieved with an improved open‐circuit voltage ( V OC ) from 1.13
  to 1.17 V. Moreover, the 2D perovskite nanosheets can effectively mitigate the iodide
  ion diffusion from perovskite to the metal electrode, hence enhancing the device
  stability. 3D/2D architectured devices retain ≈90% of their initial PCE under continuous
  illumination or heating after 1000 h, which are superior to 3D‐based devices. This
  work provides an effective and controllable strategy to construct 3D/2D vertical
  heterostructure to simultaneously boost the efficiency and stability of PVSCs.
