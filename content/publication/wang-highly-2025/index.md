abstract: Abstract  Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) are promising candidates
  for commercialization due to their outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).
  However, controlling the crystallization process and alleviating the phases/composition
  inhomogeneity represent a considerable challenge for perovskite layers grown on
  rough silicon substrates, ultimately limiting the efficiency and stability of TSC.
  Here, this study reports a “halide locking” strategy that simultaneously modulates
  the nucleation and crystal growth process of wide bandgap perovskites by introducing
  a multifunctional ammonium salt, thioacetylacetamide hydrochloride (TAACl), to bind
  with all types of cations and anions in the mixed halide perovskite precursor. The
  approach not only enables excellent compositional uniformity in the wet‐film stage
  but also induces preferred orientation along the (001) plane following nucleation,
  leading to enhanced homogeneity of the perovskite film in both vertical and horizontal
  directions over long‐length scales. The resulting wide‐bandgap perovskite solar
  cells yield exceptional open‐circuit voltage‐fill factor products ( V OC × FF) of
  1.074 and 1.040 in small‐ (0.0414 cm 2 ) and large‐area (1.0208 cm 2 ) devices,
  respectively. Corresponding large‐area tandem solar cells based on the Tunnel Oxide
  Passivated Contact (TOPCon) silicon subcells achieve a record PCE of 31.32% with
  a remarkable  V OC  of 1.931 V and FF of 81.54%.
