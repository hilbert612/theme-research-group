 abstract = {All‐inorganic perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn widespread attention for its superior thermal stability. Carbon‐based devices are promising to demonstrate excellent long‐term operational stability due to the hydrophobicity of carbon materials and the abandon of organic hole‐transporting materials (HTMs). However, the difficulty to control the crystallinity process and the poor morphology leads to serious non‐radiative recombination, resulting in low

and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this article, the crystal formation process of all‐inorganic perovskites is controlled with a facile composition engineering strategy. By bromide incorporation, high‐quality perovskite films with large grain and fewer grain boundaries are achieved. As‐prepared perovskite films demonstrate longer carrier lifetime, contributing to lower energy loss and better device performance. Fabricated carbon‐based HTM‐free PVSCs with CsPbI
