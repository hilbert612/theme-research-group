abstract: All‐inorganic perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn widespread attention
  for its superior thermal stability. Carbon‐based devices are promising to demonstrate
  excellent long‐term operational stability due to the hydrophobicity of carbon materials
  and the abandon of organic hole‐transporting materials (HTMs). However, the difficulty
  to control the crystallinity process and the poor morphology leads to serious non‐radiative
  recombination, resulting in low V OC and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this
  article, the crystal formation process of all‐inorganic perovskites is controlled
  with a facile composition engineering strategy. By bromide incorporation, high‐quality
  perovskite films with large grain and fewer grain boundaries are achieved. As‐prepared
  perovskite films demonstrate longer carrier lifetime, contributing to lower energy
  loss and better device performance. Fabricated carbon‐based HTM‐free PVSCs with
  CsPbI 2.33 Br 0.67 perovskite realized champion PCE of 12.40%, superior to 8.80%
  of CsPbI 3 ‐based devices, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported for
  the carbon‐based all‐inorganic PVSCs to date. The high V OC of 1.01 V and FF of
  70.98% indicate the significance of this composition engineering method. Moreover,
  fabricated carbon‐based devices exhibit excellent stability, and unencapsulated
  device retains over 90% of its initial efficiency under continuous one sun illumination
  for 250 h in N 2 atmosphere and keeps ~84% of its original value after stored in
  ambient environment with RH 15–20% for 200 h. This work provides a facile way to
  fabricate high‐performance and stable carbon‐based all‐inorganic PVSCs.
