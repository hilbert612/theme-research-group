abstract: Abstract  Delicately designed dopant‐free hole‐transporting materials (HTMs)
  with ordered structure have become one of the major strategies to achieve high‐performance
  perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report two donor‐π linker‐donor
  (D‐π‐D) HTMs, N01 and N02 , which consist of facilely synthesized 4,8‐di( n ‐hexyloxy)‐benzo[1,2‐
  b :4,5‐ b′ ]dithiophene as a π linker, with 10‐bromohexyl‐10 H ‐phenoxazine and
  10‐hexyl‐10 H ‐phenoxazine as donors, respectively. The N01 molecules form a two‐dimensional
  conjugated network governed by C−H⋅⋅⋅O and C−H⋅⋅⋅Br interaction between phenoxazine
  donors, and synchronously construct a three‐dimension lamellar structure with the
  aid of interlaminar π–π interaction. Consequently, N01 as a dopant‐free small‐molecule
  HTM exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties
  for hole transport, hole extraction and perovskite growth, enabling an inverted
  PSC to achieve a very impressive power conversion efficiency of 21.85 %.
