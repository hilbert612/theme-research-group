Delicately designed dopant‐free hole‐transporting materials (HTMs) with ordered structure have become one of the major strategies to achieve high‐performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report two donor‐π linker‐donor (D‐π‐D) HTMs,
N01
and
N02
, which consist of facilely synthesized 4,8‐di(
n
‐hexyloxy)‐benzo[1,2‐
b
:4,5‐
b′
]dithiophene as a π linker, with 10‐bromohexyl‐10
H
‐phenoxazine and 10‐hexyl‐10
H
‐phenoxazine as donors, respectively. The
N01
molecules form a two‐dimensional conjugated network governed by C−H⋅⋅⋅O and C−H⋅⋅⋅Br interaction between phenoxazine donors, and synchronously construct a three‐dimension lamellar structure with the aid of interlaminar π–π interaction. Consequently,
N01
as a dopant‐free small‐molecule HTM exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, hole extraction and perovskite growth, enabling an inverted PSC to achieve a very impressive power conversion efficiency of 21.85 %.},
