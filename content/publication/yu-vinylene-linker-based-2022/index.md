abstract: State-of-art Y-series polymer acceptors are typically based on a mono-thiophene
  linker, which can cause some twisted molecular conformations and thus limit the
  performance of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). Here, a high-performance polymer
  acceptor based on vinylene linkers is reported, which leads to surprising changes
  in the polymers’ molecular conformations, optoelectronic properties, and enhanced
  photovoltaic performance. It is found that the polymer acceptors based on thiophene
  or bithiophene linkers (PY-T-γ and PY-2T-γ) display significant molecular twisting
  between end-groups and linker units, while the vinylene-based polymer (PY-V-γ) exhibits
  a more coplanar and rigid molecular conformation. As a result, PY-V-γ demonstrates
  a better conjugation and tighter interchain stacking, which results in higher mobility
  and a reduced energetic disorder. Furthermore, detailed morphology investigations
  reveal that the PY-V-γ-based blend exhibits high domain purity and thus a better
  fill factor in its all-PSCs. With these, a higher efficiency of 17.1% is achieved
  in PY-V-γ-based all-PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for binary all-PSCs
  to date. This work demonstrates that the vinylene-linker is a superior unit to build
  polymer acceptors with more coplanar and rigid chain conformation, which is beneficial
  for polymer aggregation and efficient all-PSCs.
