abstract: P-i-n geometry perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer simplified fabrication,
  greater amenability to charge extraction layers, and low-temperature processing
  over n-i-p counterparts. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) can enhance the performance
  of p-i-n PSCs but ultrathin SAMs can be thermally unstable. We report a thermally
  robust hole-selective layer comprised of nickel oxide (NiO x ) nanoparticle film
  with a surface-anchored (4-(3,11-dimethoxy-7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazol-7-yl)butyl)phosphonic
  acid (MeO-4PADBC) SAM that can improve and stabilize the NiO x /perovskite interface.
  The energetic alignment and favorable contact and binding between NiO x /MeO-4PADBC
  and perovskite reduced the voltage deficit of PSCs with various perovskite compositions
  and led to strong interface toughening effects under thermal stress. The resulting
  1.53–electron-volt devices achieved 25.6% certified power conversion efficiency
  and maintained textgreater90% of their initial efficiency after continuously operating
  at 65 degrees Celsius for 1200 hours under 1-sun illumination.  ,  Editor’s summary  Inverted
  (p-i-n geometry) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have fabrication advantages compared
  with conventional cells, but the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) used to stabilize
  charge extraction layers have been prone to thermal degradation. Li et al . report
  on a phosphonic acid SAM that is anchored onto the particles in a nickel oxide film,
  optimizing the dipole moment for fast hole extraction and leading to a low defect
  density. For 1.53–electron volt p-i-n PSCs, a power conversion efficiency of 25.6%
  was achieved, and the cells maintained more than 90% of that efficiency after 1200
  hours of operation at 65°C. —Phil Szuromi  ,  A thermally stable self-assembled
  monolayer improves the contact to the hole-selective nickel oxide layer in perovskite
  solar cells.
