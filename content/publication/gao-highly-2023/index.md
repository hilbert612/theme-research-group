abstract: 'Abstract  Among the emerging photovoltaic technologies, rigid perovskite
  solar cells (PSCs) have made tremendous development owing to their exceptional power
  conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.7%. However, the record PCE of flexible
  PSCs (≈22.4%) still lags far behind their rigid counterparts and their mechanical
  stabilities are also not satisfactory. Herein, through modifying the interface between
  perovskite and hole transport layer via pentylammonium acetate (PenAAc) molecule
  a highly efficient and stable flexible inverted PSC is reported. Through synthetic
  manipulation of anion and cation, it is shown that the PenA + and Ac − have strong
  chemical binding with both acceptor and donor defects of surface‐terminating ends
  on perovskite films. The PenAAc‐modified flexible PSCs achieve a record PCE of 23.68%
  (0.08 cm 2 , certified: 23.35%) with a high open‐circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.17 V.
  Large‐area devices (1.0 cm 2 ) also realized an exceptional PCE of 21.52%. Moreover,
  the fabricated devices show excellent stability under mechanical bending, with PCE
  remaining above 91% of the original PCE even after 5000 bends.'
