abstract: Abstract  Y6, as a state‐of‐the‐art nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), is extensively
  optimized by modifying its side chains and terminal groups. However, the conformation
  effects on molecular properties and photovoltaic performance of Y6 and its derivatives
  have not yet been systematically studied. Herein, three Y6 analogs, namely, BP4T‐4F,
  BP5T‐4F, and ABP4T‐4F, are designed and synthesized. Owing to the asymmetric molecular
  design strategies, three representative molecular conformations for Y6‐type NFAs
  are obtained through regulating the lateral thiophene orientation of the fused core.
  It is found that conformation adjustment imposes comprehensive effects on the molecular
  properties in neat and blend films of these NFAs. As a result, organic solar cells
  (OSCs) fabricated with PM6:BP4T‐4F, PM6:BP5T‐4F, and PM6:ABP4T‐4F show high power
  conversion efficiency of 17.1%, 16.7%, and 15.2%, respectively. Interestingly, these
  NFAs with different conformations also show reduced energy loss ( E loss ) in devices
  via gradually suppressed nonradiative E loss . Moreover, by employing a selenium‐containing
  analog, CH1007, as the complementary third component, ternary OSCs based on PM6:BP5T‐4F:CH1007
  (1:1.02:0.18) achieve a 17.2% efficiency. This work helps shed light on engineering
  the molecular conformation of NFAs to achieve high efficiency OSCs with reduced
  voltage loss.
