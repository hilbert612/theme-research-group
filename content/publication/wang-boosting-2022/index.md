abstract: Abstract All‐polymer solar cells (all‐PSCs) have achieved impressive progress
  in photovoltaic performance and stabilities recently. However, their power conversion
  efficiencies (PCEs) still trail that of small‐molecular acceptor‐based organic solar
  cells (textgreater19%) mainly because of the inferior fill factor (FF). Herein,
  a combined homo hydrocarbon solvent and sequential deposition (SD) strategy is presented
  to boost the FF of rigid all‐PSCs to 77.7% and achieve a superior PCE of 17.7% with
  excellent stability, which is among the highest efficiencies reported for all‐PSCs
  thus far. Meanwhile, a remarkable PCE of 14.5% is realized for flexible all‐PSCs
  with outstanding mechanical stability. The blend film morphologies measurements
  suggest that the SD method enables the formation of an ideal pseudo‐bilayer film
  with bicontinuous interdigitated structure and ordered polymer packing. The numerical
  simulation result indicates that the FF enhancement mainly results from the efficient
  exciton diffusion dynamics, increased carrier mobilities, and more balanced electron/hole
  mobility ratio induced by the developed SD method. This is also confirmed by the
  FF loss analysis, which manifests that the reduced series resistance and increased
  shunt resistance are the main reasons for the reduction of FF loss. This work provides
  a promising strategy to fabricate highly efficient and stable all‐PSCs to promote
  their future development and practical manufacturing.
