abstract: Abstract Tuning the properties of non‐fullerene acceptors (NFAs) through
  halogenation, including fluorination and chlorination, represents one of the most
  promising strategies to boost the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However,
  it remains unclear how the F and Cl choice influences the molecular packing and
  performance between small‐molecule and polymeric acceptors. Here, a series of small‐molecule
  and polymeric acceptors with different amounts and types of halogenation is synthesized,
  and the effects of fluorination and chlorination between small‐molecule and polymeric
  acceptors are investigated. It is found that chlorinated small‐molecule acceptors
  lead to longer exciton diffusion length and better performance compared to the corresponding
  fluorinated ones, which attributes to their stronger intermolecular packing mode.
  For polymer acceptors, in contrast, the fluorinated polymers achieve a denser packing
  mode and better performance, because chlorinated polymers exhibit reduced intrachain
  conjugation between end group moieties and linker units. This study demonstrates
  different halogenation effects on the packing modes and performances for small‐molecule
  and polymeric acceptors, which provides important guidance for the molecule design
  of high‐performance acceptors for OSCs.
