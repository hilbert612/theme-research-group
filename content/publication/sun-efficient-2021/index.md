abstract: Abstract  Currently, the performance improvement for inverted perovskite
  solar cells (PVSCs) is mainly limited by the high open circuit voltage ( V OC )
  loss caused by detrimental non‐radiative recombination (NRR) processes. Herein,
  we report a simple and efficient way to simultaneously reduce the NRR processes
  inside perovskites and at the interface by rationally designing a new pyridine‐based
  polymer hole‐transporting material (HTM), PPY2 , which exhibits suitable energy
  levels with perovskites, high hole mobility, effective passivation of the uncoordinated
  Pb 2+ and iodide defects, as well as the capability of promoting the formation of
  high‐quality polycrystalline perovskite films. In absence of any dopants, the inverted
  PVSCs using PPY2 as the HTM deliver an encouraging PCE up to 22.41 % with a small
  V OC loss (0.40 V), among the best device performances for inverted PVSCs reported
  so far. Furthermore, PPY2 ‐based unencapsulated devices show an excellent long‐term
  photostability, and over 97 % of its initial PCE can be maintained after one sun
  constant illumination for 500 h.
