 abstract = {Further enhancing the performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is crucial for their commercialization. We report that the functionalization of multication and halide perovskite interfaces with an organometallic compound, ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc

), simultaneously enhanced the efficiency and stability of inverted PSCs. The resultant devices achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.0% and maintained \textgreater98% of their initial efficiency after continuously operating at the maximum power point for 1500 hours under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Moreover, the FcTc

-functionalized devices passed the international standards for mature photovoltaics (IEC61215:2016) and have exhibited high stability under the damp heat test (85°C and 85% relative humidity).

Organometallics stabilizing perovskites

Perovskite solar cells with inverted (p-i-n) structure can have greater stability and lifetimes than conventional n-i-p structures but usually have somewhat lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Li
et al
. report that an organometallic compound, ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate, can stabilize a multication perovskite layer of an inverted perovskite solar cells. After 1500 hours of maximum power point operation, 98% of the 25.0% PCE was maintained. The solar cell also exhibited high stability in damp heat tests. —PDS
