abstract: Further enhancing the performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar
  cells (PSCs) is crucial for their commercialization. We report that the functionalization
  of multication and halide perovskite interfaces with an organometallic compound,
  ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc 2 ), simultaneously enhanced the efficiency
  and stability of inverted PSCs. The resultant devices achieved a power conversion
  efficiency of 25.0% and maintained textgreater98% of their initial efficiency after
  continuously operating at the maximum power point for 1500 hours under simulated
  AM1.5 illumination. Moreover, the FcTc 2 -functionalized devices passed the international
  standards for mature photovoltaics (IEC61215:2016) and have exhibited high stability
  under the damp heat test (85°C and 85% relative humidity).  ,  Organometallics stabilizing
  perovskites  Perovskite solar cells with inverted (p-i-n) structure can have greater
  stability and lifetimes than conventional n-i-p structures but usually have somewhat
  lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Li et al . report that an organometallic
  compound, ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate, can stabilize a multication perovskite
  layer of an inverted perovskite solar cells. After 1500 hours of maximum power point
  operation, 98% of the 25.0% PCE was maintained. The solar cell also exhibited high
  stability in damp heat tests. —PDS  ,  Functionalizing interfaces with an organometallic
  compound created an efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cell.
