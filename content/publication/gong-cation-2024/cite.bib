Zinc‐halogen batteries are promising for sustainable energy storage, offering high redox capacities at economical price points. However, they are hindered by issues such as the irreversibility caused by the dissolution of intermediates and the sluggish charge transfer, which limit their widespread adoption. Addressing these issues, bismuth‐iodide perovskite cathodes are employed as a halogen element enriched model system. These perovskite cathodes demonstrate considerable anion redox capacities. In a combined simulation and experimental study, it is uncovered that the (BAD)BiI
