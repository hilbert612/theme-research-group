abstract: Abstract  Zinc‐halogen batteries are promising for sustainable energy storage,
  offering high redox capacities at economical price points. However, they are hindered
  by issues such as the irreversibility caused by the dissolution of intermediates
  and the sluggish charge transfer, which limit their widespread adoption. Addressing
  these issues, bismuth‐iodide perovskite cathodes are employed as a halogen element
  enriched model system. These perovskite cathodes demonstrate considerable anion
  redox capacities. In a combined simulation and experimental study, it is uncovered
  that the (BAD)BiI 4 (BAD + denotes benzamidinium) cathode, greatly improves interactions
  with iodine species and boosts charge transfer capability compared to its (BA)BiI
  4 (BA + denotes benzylaminium) counterpart. These enhancements can be attributed
  to the synergistic effects arising from stronger Bi−I···I halogen bonds and C═N─H···I
  hydrogen bonds. The (BAD)BiI 4 cathode attains a reversible I − /I 0 redox chemistry
  with 92% capacity retention after 30 000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g −1
  I , outperforming previously reported anion redox batteries. Additionally, the defect‐tolerant
  property and the I − /I 0 /I + conversion of the (BAD)BiI 4 are elucidated. The
  I 5 − forms a notably stronger bond with (BAD)BiI 4 in comparison to I 3 − , which
  effectively mitigates polyiodide shuttling. These advantageous characteristics highlight
  the promise and adaptability of the developed perovskite cathodes for high‐performance
  anion redox chemistry.
