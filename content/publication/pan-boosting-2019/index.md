abstract: 'Abstract  Generally, high light‐harvesting efficiency, electron‐injection
  efficiency, and charge‐collection efficiency are the prerequisites for high‐efficiency
  quantum‐dot‐sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). However, it is fairly difficult for
  a single QD sensitizer to meet these three requirements simultaneously. It is demonstrated
  that these parameters can be felicitously balanced by a cosensitization strategy
  through the adoption of environmental‐friendly Zn–Cu–In–Se and Zn–Cu–In–S dual QD
  sensitizers with cascade energy structure. Experimental results indicate that: i)
  the combination of the dual QDs can improve the light‐harvesting capability of the
  cells, especially in the visible light window; ii) the cosensitization approach
  can facilitate electron injection, benefitting from the cascade energy structure
  of the two QD sensitizers employed; iii) the charge‐collection efficiency can be
  remarkably enhanced by the suppressed charge‐recombination process due to the improved
  QD coverage on TiO 2 . Consequently, this cosensitization strategy delivers a new
  certified efficiency record of 12.98% for liquid‐junction QDSCs under AM 1.5G 1
  sun irradiation. Moreover, the constructed cells exhibit good stability in a high‐humidity
  environment.'
