Generally, high light‐harvesting efficiency, electron‐injection efficiency, and charge‐collection efficiency are the prerequisites for high‐efficiency quantum‐dot‐sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). However, it is fairly difficult for a single QD sensitizer to meet these three requirements simultaneously. It is demonstrated that these parameters can be felicitously balanced by a cosensitization strategy through the adoption of environmental‐friendly Zn–Cu–In–Se and Zn–Cu–In–S dual QD sensitizers with cascade energy structure. Experimental results indicate that: i) the combination of the dual QDs can improve the light‐harvesting capability of the cells, especially in the visible light window; ii) the cosensitization approach can facilitate electron injection, benefitting from the cascade energy structure of the two QD sensitizers employed; iii) the charge‐collection efficiency can be remarkably enhanced by the suppressed charge‐recombination process due to the improved QD coverage on TiO

. Consequently, this cosensitization strategy delivers a new certified efficiency record of 12.98% for liquid‐junction QDSCs under AM 1.5G 1 sun irradiation. Moreover, the constructed cells exhibit good stability in a high‐humidity environment.},
