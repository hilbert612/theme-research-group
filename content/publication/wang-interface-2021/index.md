abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) receive great attention due to their excellent
  photovoltaic performance. Recently, all‐inorganic PVSCs have been extensively studied
  owing to their superior thermal and photo stability. Among them, CsPbIBr 2 perovskite
  stands out due to its superb phase stability in ambient environment. However, the
  severe energy loss caused by non‐radiative recombination limits its development.
  Herein, a facile interface engineering method is employed to modify the electron
  transporting interface and reduce the energy loss. The insertion of a thin polyethylenimine
  ethoxylated (PEIE) film between SnO 2 and the perovskite can simultaneously tune
  the work function of SnO 2 and passivate the defects of the perovskite by the amino
  group in PEIE. Meanwhile, the PEIE interface serves as a modifier to enhance the
  crystallinity of the perovskite film, leading to enlarged grain size and reduced
  grain boundaries. As a result, the power conversion efficiency was enhanced from
  8.7% for the SnO 2 ‐based device to 11.2% for the SnO 2 /PEIE‐based device, with
  an open‐circuit voltage of 1.29 V, a short‐circuit current of 11.0 mA/cm 2 , and
  a fill factor of 78.6%. Moreover, the photostability of devices were improved, which
  retained over 80% of its initial efficiency under continuous one sun illumination
  for 500 h. This work proves the effectiveness of interface engineering to boost
  the efficiency and stability of all‐inorganic PVSCs.
