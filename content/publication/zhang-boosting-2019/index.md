abstract: Abstract  Composition engineering is a particularly simple and effective
  approach especially using mixed cations and halide anions to optimize the morphology,
  crystallinity, and light absorption of perovskite films. However, there are very
  few reports on the use of anion substitutions to develop uniform and highly crystalline
  perovskite films with large grain size and reduced defects. Here, the first report
  of employing tetrafluoroborate (BF 4 − ) anion substitutions to improve the properties
  of (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium (FAPbI 3 ) 0.83 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.17 ) perovskite
  films is demonstrated. The BF 4 − can be successfully incorporated into a mixed‐ion
  perovskite crystal frame, leading to lattice relaxation and a longer photoluminescence
  lifetime, higher recombination resistance, and 1–2 orders magnitude lower trap density
  in prepared perovskite films and derived solar cells. These advantages benefit the
  performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), resulting in an improved power conversion
  efficiency (PCE) of 20.16% from 17.55% due to enhanced open‐circuit voltage ( V
  OC ) and fill factor. This is the highest PCE for BF 4 − anion substituted lead
  halide PVSCs reported to date. This work provides insight for further exploration
  of anion substitutions in perovskites to enhance the performance of PVSCs and other
  optoelectronic devices.
