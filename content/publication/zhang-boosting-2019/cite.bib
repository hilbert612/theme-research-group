Composition engineering is a particularly simple and effective approach especially using mixed cations and halide anions to optimize the morphology, crystallinity, and light absorption of perovskite films. However, there are very few reports on the use of anion substitutions to develop uniform and highly crystalline perovskite films with large grain size and reduced defects. Here, the first report of employing tetrafluoroborate (BF

can be successfully incorporated into a mixed‐ion perovskite crystal frame, leading to lattice relaxation and a longer photoluminescence lifetime, higher recombination resistance, and 1–2 orders magnitude lower trap density in prepared perovskite films and derived solar cells. These advantages benefit the performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), resulting in an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.16% from 17.55% due to enhanced open‐circuit voltage (
