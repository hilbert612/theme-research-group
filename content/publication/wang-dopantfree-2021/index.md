abstract: Abstract  Developing low‐cost, efficient, and stable dopant‐free hole‐transporting
  materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is essential to their commercial
  deployment. Herein, the synthesis of a novel spirofluorene‐dithiolane based small
  molecular HTM, SFDT‐TDM, through facile and low‐cost synthetic routes is reported.
  The CH … π interactions in adjacent SFDT‐TDM are beneficial for high hole mobility
  and the methylthio groups in SFDT‐TDM can serve as Lewis bases to passivate the
  defects on the surface of perovskite films, leading to suppressed non‐radiative
  recombination and enhanced charge extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface. As
  a result, Cs  x  FA 1−  x  PbI 3 based PVSCs with SFDT‐TDM as the HTM realize champion
  power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 21.7% and 20.3% for small‐area (0.04 cm
  2 ) and large‐area (1.0 cm 2 ) devices with negligible photocurrent hysteresis,
  respectively. Additionally, all‐inorganic CsPbI 3−  x  Br  x  based PVSCs with SFDT‐TDM
  demonstrate an impressive PCE of 17.1% along with excellent stability. This work
  highlights the great potential of the spirofluorene core for exploring low‐cost
  and dopant‐free HTMs for PVSCs with high efficiency and stability.
