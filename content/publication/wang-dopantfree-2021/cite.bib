Developing low‐cost, efficient, and stable dopant‐free hole‐transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is essential to their commercial deployment. Herein, the synthesis of a novel spirofluorene‐dithiolane based small molecular HTM, SFDT‐TDM, through facile and low‐cost synthetic routes is reported. The CH
…
π interactions in adjacent SFDT‐TDM are beneficial for high hole mobility and the methylthio groups in SFDT‐TDM can serve as Lewis bases to passivate the defects on the surface of perovskite films, leading to suppressed non‐radiative recombination and enhanced charge extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface. As a result, Cs
