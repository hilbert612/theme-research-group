abstract: The electron transporting layer (ETL) used in high performance inverted
  perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is typically composed of C60, which requires time-consuming
  and costly thermal evaporation deposition, posing a significant challenge for large-scale
  production. To address this challenge, herein, we present a novel design of solution-processible
  electron transporting material (ETM) by grafting a non-fullerene acceptor fragment
  onto C60. The synthesized BTPC60 exhibits an exceptional solution processability
  and well-organized molecular stacking pattern, enabling the formation of uniform
  and structurally ordered film with high electron mobility. When applied as ETL in
  inverted PSCs, BTPC60 not only exhibits excellent interfacial contact with the perovskite
  layer, resulting in enhanced electron extraction and transfer efficiency, but also
  effectively passivates the interfacial defects to suppress non-radiative recombination.
  Resultant BTPC60-based inverted PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency
  (PCE) of 25.3 % and retain almost 90 % of the initial values after aging at 85 Â°C
  for 1500 hours in N2. More encouragingly, the solution-processed BTPC60 ETL demonstrates
  remarkable film thickness tolerance, and enables a high PCE up to 24.8 % with the
  ETL thickness of 200 nm. Our results highlight BTPC60 as a promising solution-processed
  fullerene-based ETM, opening an avenue for improving the scalability of efficient
  and stable inverted PSCs.
