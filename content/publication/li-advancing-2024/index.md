abstract: Abstract To achieve carbon neutrality and sustainable development, innovative
  solar‐to‐fuel systems have been designed through the integration of solar energy
  harvesting and electrochemical devices. Over the last decade, there have been notable
  advancements in enhancing the efficiency and durability of these solar‐to‐fuel systems.
  Despite the advancements, there remains significant potential for further improvements
  in the performance of systems. Enhancements can be achieved by optimizing electrochemical
  catalysts, advancing the manufacturing technologies of photovoltaics and electrochemical
  cells, and refining the overall design of these systems. In the realm of catalyst
  optimization, the effectiveness of materials can be significantly improved through
  active site engineering and strategic use of functional groups. Similarly, the performance
  of electrochemical devices can be enhanced by incorporating specific additives into
  electrolytes and optimizing gas diffusion electrodes. Improvements in solar harvesting
  devices are achievable through efficient passivant and self‐assembled monolayers,
  which enhance the overall quality and efficiency of these systems. Additionally,
  optimizing the energy conversion efficiency involves the strategic use of DC converters,
  photoelectrodes, and redox media. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview
  of the advancements in solar‐powered electrochemical energy conversion systems,
  laying a solid foundation for future research and development in the field of energy
  sustainability.
