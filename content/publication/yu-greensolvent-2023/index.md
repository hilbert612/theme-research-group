abstract: Abstract The commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) urgently
  requires the development of green‐solvent processable dopant‐free hole transporting
  materials (HTMs). However, strong intermolecular interactions that ensure high hole
  mobility always compromise the solubility and film‐forming ability in green solvents.
  Herein, we show a simple but effective design strategy to solve this trade‐off,
  that is, constructing star‐shaped D‐A‐D structure. The resulting HTMs (BTP1‐2) can
  be processed by green solvent of 2‐methylanisole (2MA), a kind of food additive,
  and show high hole mobility and multiple defect passivation effects. An impressive
  efficiency of 24.34 % has been achieved for 2MA‐processed BTP1 based inverted PVSCs,
  the highest value for green‐solvent processable HTMs so far. Moreover, it is manifested
  that the charge separation of D‐A type HTMs at the photoinduced excited state can
  help to passivate the defects of perovskites, indicating a new HTM design insight.
