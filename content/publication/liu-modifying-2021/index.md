abstract: Abstract  It is highly desirable for all‐inorganic perovskite solar cells
  (PVSCs) to have reduced nonideal interfacial charge recombination in order to improve
  the performance. Although the construction of a 2D capping layer on 3D perovskite
  is an effective way to suppress interfacial nonradiative recombination, it is difficult
  to apply it to all‐inorganic perovskites because of the resistance of Cs + cesium
  ions in cation exchange reactions. To alleviate this problem, a simple approach
  using an ultra‐thin 2D perovskite to terminate CsPbI 3 grain boundaries (GBs) without
  damaging the original 3D perovskite is developed. The 2D perovskite at the GBs not
  only enhances the charge‐carrier extraction and transport but also effectively suppresses
  nonradiative recombination. In addition, because the 2D perovskite can prevent the
  moisture and oxygen from penetrating into the GBs and at the same time suppress
  the ion migration, the 2D terminated CsPbI 3 films exhibit significantly improved
  stability against humidity. Moreover, the devices without encapsulation can retain
  ≈81% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after being stored at 40 ± 5%
  relative humidity for 84 h. The 2D‐based champion device exhibits a high PCE of
  18.82% with a high open‐circuit voltage of 1.16 V.
