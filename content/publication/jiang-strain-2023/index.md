abstract: Abstract  Inverted (p‐i‐n) perovskite solar cells have drawn great attention
  due to their outstanding stability and low‐temperature processibility. However,
  their power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags behind conventional (n‐i‐p) devices
  mainly due to the lack of strategies to stabilize α ‐FAPbI 3 without changing the
  bandgap. In this work, a facile and effective strategy is reported to regulate the
  residual strain via pseudo halide‐based ionic liquids incorporation to stabilize
  α ‐FAPbI 3 perovskite in inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The employment
  of methylamine formate (MAFa) ionic liquid enables a homogenously stronger compressive
  strain to restrain the transition of shared‐corner PbI 6 octahedron into shared‐face
  δ ‐FAPbI 3 , as well as affecting the dynamic behavior of carriers and defects to
  achieve a record PCE (24.08%) among the reported inverted FAPbI 3 perovskite solar
  cells up to now. In addition, the MAFa incorporation results in enhanced device
  stability, unencapsulated PVSC retains over 90% of its initial efficiency after
  stored in ambient environment (RH:30 ± 5%) for 1000 h. This work provides an efficient
  strategy to realize efficient and stable α ‐FAPbI 3 based inverted PVSCs to further
  catch up with the conventional ones.
