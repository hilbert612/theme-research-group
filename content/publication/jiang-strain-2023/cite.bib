Inverted (p‐i‐n) perovskite solar cells have drawn great attention due to their outstanding stability and low‐temperature processibility. However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags behind conventional (n‐i‐p) devices mainly due to the lack of strategies to stabilize

In addition, the MAFa incorporation results in enhanced device stability, unencapsulated PVSC retains over 90% of its initial efficiency after stored in ambient environment (RH:30 ± 5%) for 1000 h. This work provides an efficient strategy to realize efficient and stable
