abstract: 'Abstract  Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) have garnered
  significant attention due to their potential for achieving high photovoltaic (PV)
  performance. However, the reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and fill
  factors (FFs) are still subpar due to the challenges associated with charge extraction
  in the organic bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) and significant energy losses in the interconnecting
  layers (ICLs). Here, a quaternary organic BHJ blend is developed to enhance the
  charge extraction in the organic subcell, contributing to an increased FF of ≥78%
  under 1 sun illumination and even more under lower illumination intensities. Meanwhile,
  energy losses in the ICLs are reduced via the incorporation of a self‐assembly monolayer
  (SAM), (4‐(3,6‐Dimethyl‐9H‐carbazol‐9‐yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (Me‐4PACz), in organic
  BHJ to form a MoO x /SAM interface and the thorough control of the MoO  x  thickness
  to suppress parasitic absorption. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable PCE
  of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record FF of 83.62%, which is among the highest
  PCEs of POTSCs and the highest FF of all types of perovskite‐based tandem solar
  cells (TSCs) till now. This work proves the optimization of charge extraction and
  ICLs are effective strategies to promote the performance of POTSCs to surpass other
  solution‐processed perovskite‐based TSCs in the near future.'
