abstract: Abstract Bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) are prepared
  by a common one‐step solution casting of donor‐acceptor blends often encounter dynamic
  morphological evolution which is hard to control to achieve optimal performance.
  To overcome this hurdle, a generally applicable, sequential processing approach
  has been developed to construct high‐performance OSCs without involving tedious
  processes. The morphology of photoactive layers comprising a polymer donor (PM6)
  and a nonfullerene acceptor (denoted as Y6‐BO) can be precisely manipulated by tuning
  Y6‐BO layer with a small amount of 1‐chloronaphthalene additive to induce the structural
  order of Y6‐BO molecules to impact the blend phase. The results of a comparative
  investigation elucidate that such two‐step procedure can afford more favorable BHJ
  microstructure than that achievable with the single blend‐casting route. This translates
  into improved carrier generation and transport, and suppressed charge recombination.
  Consequently, the devices based on sequential deposition (SD) deliver a remarkable
  efficiency up to 17.2% (the highest for SD OSCs to date), outperforming that from
  the conventional BHJ devices (16.4%). The general applicability of this approach
  has also been tested on several other nonfullerene acceptors which show similar
  improvements. These results highlight that SD is a promising processing alternative
  to promote better photovoltaic performance and reduce production requirements.
