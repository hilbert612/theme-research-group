abstract: Abstract Inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have recently made exciting
  progress, showing high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25% in single-junction
  devices and 30.5% in silicon/perovskite tandem devices. The hole transporting material
  (HTM) in an inverted PVSC plays an important role in determining the device performance,
  since it not only extracts/transports holes but also affects the growth and crystallization
  of perovskite film. Currently, polymer and self-assembled monolayer (SAM) have been
  considered as two types of most promising HTM candidates for inverted PVSCs owing
  to their high PCEs, high stability and adaptability to large area devices. In this
  review, recent encouraging progress of high-performance polymer and SAM-based HTMs
  is systematically reviewed and summarized, including molecular design strategies
  and the correlation between molecular structure and device performance. We hope
  this review can inspire further innovative development of HTMs for wide applications
  in highly efficient and stable inverted PVSCs and the tandem devices.  Graphical
