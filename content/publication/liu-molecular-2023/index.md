abstract: Abstract  Metal–organic framework (MOF) solids with their variable functionalities
  are relevant for energy conversion technologies. However, the development of electroactive
  and stable MOFs for electrocatalysis still faces challenges. Here, a molecularly
  engineered MOF system featuring a 2D coordination network based on mercaptan–metal
  links (e.g., nickel, as for Ni(DMBD)‐MOF) is designed. The crystal structure is
  solved from microcrystals by a continuous‐rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique.
  Computational results indicate a metallic electronic structure of Ni(DMBD)‐MOF due
  to the Ni–S coordination, highlighting the effective design of the thiol ligand
  for enhancing electroconductivity. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical
  studies indicate that (DMBD)‐MOF offers advantages in the electrocatalytic oxygen
  evolution reaction (OER) over non‐thiol (e.g., 1,4‐benzene dicarboxylic acid) analog
  (BDC)‐MOF, because it poses fewer energy barriers during the rate‐limiting *O intermediate
  formation step. Iron‐substituted NiFe(DMBD)‐MOF achieves a current density of 100
  mA cm −2 at a small overpotential of 280 mV, indicating a new MOF platform for efficient
  OER catalysis.
