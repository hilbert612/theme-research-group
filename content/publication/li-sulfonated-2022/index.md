abstract: Abstract  The potential leakage of lead from degraded perovskite photovoltaics
  poses a threat to the ecosystem and human health, which is a severe hurdle for their
  commercialization, especially for flexible modules that are often integrated in
  applications used in daily living. To trap the lead from degraded flexible perovskite
  solar modules (PVSMs), sulfonated graphene aerogels mixed with polydimethylsiloxane
  are employed to serve as lead‐absorbing encapsulants on both sides of flexible PVSMs.
  The large specific area of sulfonated graphene aerogels and their high binding energy
  with Pb 2+ give them superior lead adsorption capacity in aqueous solution. Over
  99% of Pb 2+ from the degraded flexible PVSMs can be captured by the encapsulant
  under different simulated conditions (scratching, bending, and thermal circling)
  to reduce the lead leakage to ≈10 ppb. Moreover, the lead from degraded flexible
  PVSMs can be minimized to far below the hazardous waste limit according to the resource
  conservation and recovery act regulation (RCRA). This work provides an effective
  strategy to realize safe‐to‐use perovskite‐based flexible electronics to facilitate
  their commercialization.
