abstract: Abstract  NiO x is one of the promising inorganic hole transporting materials
  in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), however, its device efficiency and stability
  are still limited by the energy level mismatch, low intrinsic conductivity, high
  interface defect density, and complex active species. Herein, the use of an imide‐based
  donor–acceptor type semiconductor (BTF14) as the interlayer between perovskite and
  NiO x is proposed, which facilitates the hole extraction and transfer, reduces the
  defect density at interface and in perovskite film bulk, and further reduces the
  concentration of Ni textgreater3+ species to stabilize the heterointerface. As a
  result, the power conversion efficiency of inverted PSCs can be significantly boosted
  from 22.11% of NiO x to 24.20% of NiO x /BTF14. Moreover, NiO x /BTF14 based devices
  also exhibit negligible hysteresis and excellent long‐term stability, with over
  77% of their initial efficiency remaining after continuous operation at 60 °C for
  1000 h under 1 sun illumination.
