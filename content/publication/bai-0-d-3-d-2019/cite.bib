Although organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have achieved dramatic improvement in device efficiency, their long‐term stability remains a major concern prior to commercialization. To address this issue, extensive research efforts are dedicated to exploiting all‐inorganic PVSCs by using cesium (Cs)‐based perovskite materials, such as α‐CsPbI
3
. However, the black‐phase CsPbI
3
(cubic α‐CsPbI
3
and orthorhombic γ‐CsPbI
3
phases) is not stable at room temperature, and it tends to convert to the nonperovskite δ‐CsPbI
3
phase. Here, a simple yet effective approach is described to prepare stable black‐phase CsPbI
3
by forming a heterostructure comprising 0D Cs
4
PbI
6
and γ‐CsPbI
3
through tuning the stoichiometry of the precursors between CsI and PbI. Such heterostructure is manifested to enable the realization of a stable all‐inorganic PVSC with a high power conversion efficiency of 16.39%. This work provides a new perspective for developing high‐performance and stable all‐inorganic PVSCs.},
