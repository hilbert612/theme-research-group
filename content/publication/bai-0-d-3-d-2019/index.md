abstract: Abstract  Although organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs)
  have achieved dramatic improvement in device efficiency, their long‐term stability
  remains a major concern prior to commercialization. To address this issue, extensive
  research efforts are dedicated to exploiting all‐inorganic PVSCs by using cesium
  (Cs)‐based perovskite materials, such as α‐CsPbI 3 . However, the black‐phase CsPbI
  3 (cubic α‐CsPbI 3 and orthorhombic γ‐CsPbI 3 phases) is not stable at room temperature,
  and it tends to convert to the nonperovskite δ‐CsPbI 3 phase. Here, a simple yet
  effective approach is described to prepare stable black‐phase CsPbI 3 by forming
  a heterostructure comprising 0D Cs 4 PbI 6 and γ‐CsPbI 3 through tuning the stoichiometry
  of the precursors between CsI and PbI. Such heterostructure is manifested to enable
  the realization of a stable all‐inorganic PVSC with a high power conversion efficiency
  of 16.39%. This work provides a new perspective for developing high‐performance
  and stable all‐inorganic PVSCs.
