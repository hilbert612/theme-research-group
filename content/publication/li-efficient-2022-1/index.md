abstract: Abstract  In tin perovskite solar cells (PSCs), fullerene (C 60 ) and fullerene
  derivative [6,6]‐phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are commonly utilized
  electron transport materials. However, the energetic disorder, inadequate passivation,
  and energy level mismatch of C 60 and PCBM limit the improvement of power conversion
  efficiency (PCE) and lifespan of tin PSCs. In this work, a multifunctional interface
  manipulation strategy is developed by introducing a pyridine‐functionalized fullerene
  derivative, fullerene‐n‐butyl‐pyridine (C 60 ‐BPy), into the interface between the
  tin perovskite and the electron transport layer (ETL) to improve the photovoltaic
  performance and stability of tin PSCs. The C 60 ‐BPy can strongly anchor on the
  perovskite surface via coordination interactions between the pyridine moiety and
  the Sn 2+ ion, which not only reinforces the passivation of the trap‐state within
  the tin perovskite film, but also regulates the interface energy level alignment
  to reduce non‐radiative recombination. Moreover, the improved interface binding
  and carrier transport properties of C 60 ‐BPy contribute to superior device stability.
  The resulting devices have achieved the highest PCE of 14.14% with negligible hysteresis,
  and are maintained over 95% of their initial PCE under continuous one‐sun illumination
  for 1000 h.
