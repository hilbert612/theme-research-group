abstract: Abstract  Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) are gaining attention
  due to their easy fabrication, potential to surpass the S‐Q limit, and superior
  flexibility. However, the low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of wide bandgap
  (Eg) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have hindered their development. This work presents
  a novel and effective mixed‐cation passivation strategy (CE) to passivate various
  types of traps in wide‐Eg perovskite. The complementary effect of 4‐trifluoro phenethylammonium
  (CF 3 ‐PEA + , denoted as CA + ) and ethylenediammonium (EDA 2+ , denoted as EA
  2+ ) reduces both electron/hole defect densities and non‐radiative recombination
  rate, resulting in a record open‐circuit voltage ( V oc ) of wide‐Eg PVSCs (1.35 V)
  and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of
  24.47% when applied to fabricated POTSCs, the highest PCE to date. Furthermore,
  unencapsulated POTSCs exhibit excellent photo and thermal stability, retaining over
  90% of their initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking or exposure to
  60 °C for 500 h. These findings imply that the synergic effect of surface passivators
  is a promising strategy to achieve high‐efficiency and stable wide‐Eg PVSCs and
  corresponding POTSCs.
