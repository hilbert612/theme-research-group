abstract: Abstract  Lead halide perovskite and organic solar cells (PSCs and OSCs)
  are considered as the prime candidates currently for clean energy applications due
  to their solution and low‐temperature processibility. Nevertheless, the substantial
  photon loss in near‐infrared (NIR) region and relatively large photovoltage deficit
  need to be improved to enable their uses in high‐performance solar cells. To mitigate
  these disadvantages, low‐bandgap organic bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) layer into inverted
  PSCs to construct facile hybrid solar cells (HSCs) is integrated. By optimizing
  the BHJ components, an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.80%, with
  a decent open‐circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 1.146 V and extended photoresponse over
  950 nm for rigid HSCs is achieved. The resultant devices also exhibit superior long‐term
  (over 1000 h) ambient‐ and photostability compared to those from single‐component
  PSCs and OSCs. More importantly, a champion PCE of 21.73% and excellent mechanical
  durability can also be achieved in flexible HSCs, which is the highest efficiency
  reported for flexible solar cells to date. Taking advantage of these impressive
  device performances, flexible HSCs into a power source for wearable sensors to demonstrate
  real‐time temperature monitoring are successfully integrated.
